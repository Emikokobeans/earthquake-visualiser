# Earthquake Visualiser

A pair programming exercise to practice using data from thrid party API's and creating interactive React apps.

For this exercise we chose to create a Earthquake visualiser which allows the user to select a past date to see how many and where eartquakes occurred on a map. The user is also able to interact with the map, as well as seeing more information about the earthquake (visualised as a circle) by simply hovering over.

The API used: [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)
